 **** WEBSTART **** 
Start/stop xbmc from a webpage.

The page reflects XBMC current status, and allows to start or stop it with a single button.

The apache user (usually www-data) needs to have passwordless sudo on these initctl commands :
- initctl status xbmc
- initctl start xbmc
- initctl stop xbmc
